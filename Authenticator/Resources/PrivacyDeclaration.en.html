    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        This is the privacy declaration of Authenticator for Windows. With all respect for your privacy, we try to limit the required data to a minimal amount. We always adhere to the rules set by the Data Protection Act. For all permissions the app uses, we explain why it's being used.

    <h2>Camera</h2>
    <p>
        The camera in your device can be used to scan codes. While scanning, there will be searched for a QR code to read. This will always be processed locally and will NEVER be sent over the internet.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet connection</h2>
    <p>
        Your internet connection is being used to retrieve the most precise time from an NTP server. You can turn this off at any time to prevent data usage.
